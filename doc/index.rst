Nonsence Web documentation
==========================

This is the documentation for Nonsence version 1.0.0.

Introduction
------------
Nonsence Web is a Lua module / toolkit (whatever) for developing web applications in Lua. It is different from all the other
Lua HTTP servers out there in that it's modern, fresh, object oriented and easy to modify. 

Its main features and design principles are:

- Simple and intuitive API

- Good documentation

- Few dependencies

- Event driven, asynchronous and threadless design

- Extremely fast with LuaJIT

- Written completely in pure Lua

- Linux Epoll support

- Small footprint
