Supported poll implementations at this point:
epoll_ffi (if you are running LuaJIT)
epoll

Planned poll implementation support
kqueue (through LuaJIT FFI and a C module)
select (for Windows developers)

Required C modules when running with Lua or LuaJIT:
	Nixio (https://github.com/Neopallium/nixio)
	Used for socket handling and bit operations (LuaJIT bit operations are used).

Required C modules if you are running Lua (without the JIT):
	Lua Epoll. (https://github.com/Neopallium/lua-epoll)
